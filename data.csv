"about half of that 2% difference between the genomes comes from ~1000 now inactive olfactory genes in humans (sense of smell). others have macro physical effects, like bone morphology to better support bipedalism and a reduction in hair development. what about the brain? the few differences in genes that deal with the brain affect cell division. specifically, they cause neural progenitor cells, which are responsible for producing all the neurons in your brain, to divide 3 to 4 more times during the development of human brains, resulting in more neurons than would be found in chimp brains. quantity simply begets complexity.",info,,,,257.9,"5,597,600.00","402,400.00",257.9,20.0,0.05,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ZuWbX-CyE
