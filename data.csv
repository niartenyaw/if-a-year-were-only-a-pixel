"there isn't really a plethora of information about what happened a long time ago. most of it is lost to the wheel of time. as individuals die, their bodies and belongings decay and decompose. something out of the ordinary has to happen for pieces of body, including bone, to persist for so long. those fungi must be hungry!",info,,,,80.0,"5,920,000.00","80,000.00",80.0,40.0,0.02,
