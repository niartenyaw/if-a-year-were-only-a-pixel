"there isn't really a plethora of information about what happened a long time ago. most of it is lost to the wheel of time. as individuals die, their bodies and belongings decay and decompose. something out of the ordinary has to happen for pieces of body, including bone, to persist for so long. those fungi must be hungry!",info,,,,80.0,"5,875,200.00","124,800.00",80.0,40.0,0.02,

"they might have separated (consciously or not) due to any number of different causes, such as: food scarcity due to growing populations or a changing climate, simply following the migration of animals they hunted, or maybe there was a struggle for power within the community. we can postulate all we want, but no one knows and we will probably never know. forever lost to time.",info,,,,280.0,"5,563,200.00","436,800.00",280.0,40.0,0.05,
