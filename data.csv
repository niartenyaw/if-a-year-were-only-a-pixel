"somewhere between 10 and 6 mya, a part of that population stopped mating with the rest. one group would evolve into current day humans; the other, into current day chimpanzees. current day chimps evolved from that ancestor just like we did. saying ""humans evolved from chimps"" is incorrect. chimps might not have acquired as many mutations to their genome as humans have over the last 6 million years and therefore seem more similar to that ancestor, but that doesn't make them the same.",info,,,,135.0,"5,789,400.00","210,600.00",135.0,20.0,0.03,

"with every generation, every individual has the potential to introduce new mutations to the gene pool. these mutations can occur spontaneously (molecular decay), during DNA replication and repair, or when DNA comes in contact with mutagens such as radiation or acid. most mutations cause a negative effect on the individual's ability to thrive, often resulting in the individual dying and therefore not passing that mutation to the next generation (or passing it to the next generation fewer times than others) so we often only see gene pools acquire random mutations that produce a net benefit or litte to no change.",info,,,,217.9,"5,660,000.00","340,000.00",217.9,20.0,0.04,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation#Causes

"those differences include ~1000 now inactive olfactory genes in humans (negatively affecting our sense of smell). others produce macro physical effects, like bone morphology to better support bipedalism and a reduction in hair development. what about the brain? other mutations result in the creation of 3-4x more neurons than would be found in chimp brains. quantity can simply beget complexity. a mutation in the FOXP2 gene seems to be involved in encouraging complex and frequent vocalizations, possibly responsible for our capacity of complex language.",info,,,,257.9,"5,597,600.00","402,400.00",257.9,20.0,0.05,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ZuWbX-CyE
