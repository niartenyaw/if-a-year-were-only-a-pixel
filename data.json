{"title":"the time range is pretty large because we don't have direct evidence of the real \"last common ancestor\" of chimps and humans, nor do we expect to find it. that would entail finding the exact bones of that particular individual, which unfortunately doesn't seem very likely.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"15.0"},
{"title":"there isn't really a plethora of information about what happened a long time ago. most of it is lost to the wheel of time. as individuals die, their bodies and belongings decay and decompose. something out of the ordinary has to happen for pieces of body, including bone, to persist for so long. those fungi must be hungry!","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"35.0"},
{"title":"but that doesn't mean archeaologists don't know what they're talking about. archeaologists and geologists have been slowly piecing together clues for hundreds of years that include essentially every scientific field and many thousands of research papers.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"55.0"},
{"title":"archeaologists have uncovered thousands of fossils that span the evolutionary path of many species, including many related to humans and our ancestors. in fact, some of them very well may have been our actual ancestors. it's just really hard to be that specific.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"75.0"},
{"title":"imagine looking at a large tree from a bit of a distance. you can easily identify the trunk, the main branches, even a lot of the secondary and tertiary branches. yet, it proves difficult to start at a single leaf and track every single branch that connects it down to the main trunk. some of it may be obscured by other branches or leaves or blend together, making it unclear which exact branch it really is. just because some of the fine details may be a bit fuzzy doesn't mean the overall structure isn't apparent.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"95.0"},
{"title":"also, there wasn't a single \"ancestor\", there were many. a whole population. potentially even multiple familial groups all living in close proximity with occasional to frequent mating between them. all a part of the same species, one gene pool.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"115.0"},
{"title":"somewhere between 10 and 6 mya, a part of that population stopped mating with the others. one group would evolve into current day humans; the other, into current day chimpanzees. current day chimps evolved from that ancestor just like we did. saying \"humans evolved from chimps\" is incorrect. chimps might not have acquired as many mutations as humans have over the last 6 million years and therefore seem more similar to that ancestor, but that doesn't make them the same.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"135.0"},
{"title":"the groups could have separated, whether purposeful or not, due to any number of causes. food scarcity caused by growing populations or a changing habitat, following the migration of animal herds they hunted, or maybe there was a disagreement or struggle for power within the community. we can postulate all we want, but no one knows and we will probably never know. forever lost to time.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"155.0"},

{"title":"with every generation, every individual has the potential to introduce new mutations to the gene pool. these mutations can occur spontaneously (molecular decay), during DNA replication and repair, or when DNA comes in contact with mutagens such as radiation or acid. most mutations cause a negative effect on the individual's ability to thrive, often resulting in the individual dying and therefore not passing that mutation to the next generation (or passing it to the next generation fewer times than others).","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"217.9"},

{"title":"about half of that 2% difference between the genomes comes from ~1000 now inactive olfactory genes in humans (sense of smell). others have macro physical effects, like bone morphology to better support bipedalism and a reduction in hair development. what about the brain? the few differences in genes that deal with the brain affect cell division. specifically, they cause neural progenitor cells, which are responsible for producing all the neurons in your brain, to divide 3 to 4 more times during the development of human brains, resulting in more neurons than would be found in chimp brains. quantity simply begets complexity.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"257.9"},
