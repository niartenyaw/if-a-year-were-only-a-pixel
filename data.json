{"title":"the time range is pretty large because we don't have direct evidence of the real \"last common ancestor\" of chimps and humans, nor do we expect to find it. that would entail finding the exact bones of that particular individual, which unfortunately doesn't seem very likely.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"40.0"},
{"title":"there isn't really a plethora of information about what happened a long time ago. most of it is lost to the wheel of time. as individuals die, their bodies and belongings decay and decompose. something out of the ordinary has to happen for pieces of body, including bone, to persist for so long. those fungi must be hungry!","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"80.0"},

{"title":"for archeaologists, it's like looking at a tree while squinting. you can identify the trunk, the main branches, even a lot of the secondary and tertiary branches. yet, starting at a single leaf and tracking every single branch down to the main trunk proves to be difficult. the fine details may be a bit fuzzy, but the overall structure is pretty apparent.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"165.0"},

{"title":"they might have separated (consciously or not) due to any number of different causes, such as: food scarcity due to growing populations or a changing climate, simply following the migration of animals they hunted, or maybe there was a struggle for power within the community. we can postulate all we want, but no one knows and we will probably never know. forever lost to time.","type":"info","year":null,"years_ago":null,"years_from_beginning":null,"feet_from_beginning":"280.0"},
